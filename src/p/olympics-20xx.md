projPrompt: I was challenged to conceptualize a brand for a future Olympic Games.
projDesc: "It's a big ask. The Valivaryus Project is an on-going project that I
  wish to use to tackle misunderstandings for various neurodivergencies. The
  initiative I created as a part of my degree project addresses Down Syndrome in
  particular due to my sister's personal experiences and my own observations
  over the course of our lives.

  Initially, this was a pointed effort to address the lack of funding in
  public education settings. My research and interviews led me to develop and
  design a piece that would address common-day pain points to tackle where the
  lack of awareness and funding shortfalls really start to rear their heads.\r
